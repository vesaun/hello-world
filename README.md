Basic introduction to using GitHub by Vesaun Shrestha

This repository serves as my introduction into GitHub and exploring how to create branches, commits and merge changes to the main production. 
This is for my CSCI 1000 class which guides us through the working environment and networking aspects of computer science. I am enrolled in this class at the University of Colorado Boulder as a first year studying computer science to attain a BS Computer Science degree.
